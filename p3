Today I learnt more briefly about Git Cherry Pick and Merge conflicts.
And also explain very briefly with a practical example.


Git 

CherryPick: When we have multiple feature files in a feature branch; but I only need to merge a specfic file to the main branch,
I use that specific files commit id merged into the main branch instead of merging all the files from the feature branch.
Advantages : if we want to control the collaborate safely across branches without creating unnecessary conflicts.
To fix bugs quickly in production without merging unfinished features
Syntax: git cherry-pick <branchname>


Merge: The standard way of combining/merging all the files from one branch to the master branch.
Use case:
Often used in feature-to-main integration,
team collaboration,
and release preparation.

While merging from one brnch to main branch Conflicts may occur if the same lines are modified which is called merge conflict
A merge conflict happens when Git cannot automatically combine changes from two branches because the same lines were modified. I open the file, look at the conflict markers, decide which changes to keep or combine, remove the markers, and then commit the resolved file.
